MODEL EVALUATION
Experiments:
(Remember the recipe)

Binary Classification:
Metrics: Errors and Accuracy (1 - error)


Modern Recipe:
.. Split your data into train and test data set.
.. Choose model ONLY using train set.
.. State hypothesis
.. Test hypothesis using test data.

Never use the test data more than once. Use the train data set alone.

Better recipe
Data set = Training + Validation + Test data

Initially
Train on : Training
Test on : Validation

Finally
Train on : Training + Validation
Test on : Test data

Warning: For temporal data, (with time as scale): Be very careful in choosing the test data
